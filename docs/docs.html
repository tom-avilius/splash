                <h2>Installation Instructions</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Click on this <a href="">link</a> to download splash for linux. Support for windows will be added by late April 2023.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Now open the archive and click on the package. Wait for the package to be installed by you package manager. 
                        </li>
                        <span id="theme"></span>
                        <li>
                            (optional) Add the application to the list of startup programs. A simple google search can reveal in depth how to do it. However, you can also do a search in your system to find the setting.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Splash installation is complete. To install themes checkout this <a href="">link</a>.

                <h2>Installing a theme</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Download a desired theme from the <a href="">themes section</a>  of the splash website.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unarchive the theme, if it is archived.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Move the theme folder (generally with the same name as that of the theme) into any directory or location where it would be safe and not be deleted. I recommend you to move it inside the documents folder.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Open the theme folder you moved and find a file with the same name as that of the theme itself and ends with '.html' extension. Example: <span>themeName.html</span>. Right click on the file and copy the (absolute) path of the file.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Head to the documents folder of your PC and find a folder named 'splash'. Open the folder. Inside the folder you will find a 'config.json' file. Open the file in a text editor (notepad) and change the text following the 'path:' key. Do not change anything else. Do not remove any inverted quotes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you encountered any problem during any procedure, please reach out to me using the issue <a href="">contact me form</a> or by opening an <a href="">issue</a> on github.

                <h2>Getting Ready</h2>

                <p>This section of the Documentation will guide you through the journey of creating stunning and productive desktop screens for the splash application.</p>

               <h3>Prerequisites: </h3>

               <ul>
                <li>
                    Atleast Beginner level html, css and javascript knowledge.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Splash application is installed and you have read through the basic user documentation above.
                </li>
               </ul>

               <br>

               <p>
                It is important to understand how the splash application works in order to be comfortable developing with it. <br>
                Splash renders a frameless, non-movable and non-resizable window. The width of the window is equal to the width of the available screen and the height is equal to the total height minus 5 pixels. It cannot be made fullscreen by the user by using the F11 key
                will always be at the bottom of the z-index of the desktop. The window is capable of rendering html, css and javascript 
                just as a browser can; complete with the chrome dev tools.
               </p>
